Anime (animated ﬁlm and television) have been a part of global screen culture since the 1960s (Drazen 2003). From that time these animated Japanese series and ﬁlms became part of American children’s television, before a second wave of anime ﬁlms in the 1980s brought a new dystopic future vision to the world. Miyazaki Hayao’s ﬁlms span these two extremes – from child-friendly narratives featuring cuddly creatures to ﬁlms that deal with death, war and adult responsibility. Alongside Tezuka Osamu, renowned as the grandfather of Japanese anime (Drazen 2003: 4–12; Napier 2001a: 16), Miyazaki is probably the best-known and best-regarded Japanese animator in the world. Thanks to a 1996 distribution deal struck between Miyazaki’s ﬁlm company and Disney, his anime ﬁlms are now also among the most widely available in the world. Despite anime’s signiﬁcant presence in many of the world’s larger markets for ﬁlm and television, little academic work has been undertaken to investigate its global impact. Where studies of anime as a global phenomenon do exist, they tend to understand the globalisation of anime as its Americanisation (Napier 2001a: 23). This chapter intends rather to think of anime as global in the sense that John Tomlinson proposes, that globalisation in culture relates to ‘how our sense of cultural belonging – of being “at home” – may be subtly transﬁgured by the penetration of globalizing media into our everyday lives’. (Tomlinson 1999: 10) Many authors, especially those working on anime fandom, have claimed that it is anime’s ‘otherness’ and difference from ‘mainstream’ culture that inspires its fans (Cubbison 2005; Napier 2001b). Such claims, although valid, obscure the increasing niche that anime occupies in ﬁlm and television culture inside and beyond Japan. In the UK, for instance, recent years have seen an explosion in the availability of anime on the high street, on cable television and in cinemas. Anime’s increasing familiarity and consistent presence therefore suggests that it is slowly becoming absorbed into the ‘mainstream’, rather than being straightforwardly alternative to it. This chapter will consequently seek to redress some of the imbalance in scholarship about anime’s ‘difference’ by examining three markets in which anime have traditionally thrived: Japan, anime’s birthplace and most signiﬁcant market; France, where Miyazaki’s ﬁlms in particular have thrived; and America, which has a long history of presenting anime to audiences (albeit surreptitiously) often in re-edited and dubbed forms. The theme of identity through language is central to Miyazaki’s Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (originally released in Japan in 2001.) A similar theme played out at the level of the ﬁlm’s release in its various global and linguistically distinct markets as gradually Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi became Le Voyage de Chihiro which in turn was reinscribed with the title Spirited Away.1 As these titles suggest, the further Miyazaki’s ﬁlm moved west, towards its American release in September 2002, the more negotiation and change took place. Moreover, the further the ﬁlm travelled, the more it moved away from its initial ‘blockbuster’ roots. In Japan the ﬁlm was a popular hit, breaking all box-ofﬁce records, whereas by the time Spirited Away was released in the United States it was being positioned as art worthy of Academy Award-winning status. The changes were wrought at the level of Sen to Chihiro’s text, through linguistic translations and in its marketing, as Japanese elements were progressively siphoned off or altered in attempts to market the ﬁlm to the maximum of potential global audiences. The term ‘global markets’ is an apt one because, although Sen to Chihiro may have changed to suit its circumstances, it never became the exclusive cultural property of any nation other than Japan. Instead, Japaneseness will be shown to have been essential to Sen to Chihiro in its movement through cultures, however much the notion of the national was conﬂicted and contested. First, as the nature of Sen to Chihiro’s multiple translations may suggest, every major ‘global’ ﬁlm released is in fact signiﬁcantly altered so that it can be sold to linguistically and culturally distinct markets (Hewitt 2003: 73). Second, due to the success of American ﬁlm abroad, other geo-cultural ﬁlm products and markets remain under-scrutinised (Hesmondhalgh 2002: 178–81). As the ﬁlm under consideration here is Japanese in origin, discussions of ‘globalisation’ will be inverted, as they do not, and cannot in their American conceptualisation, account for the shifting power relations that manipulated Sen to Chihiro after it left its domestic market. Nor do America-centric discussions of the blockbuster account for Sen to Chihiro’s domestic success (e.g. Neale and Smith 1998; Sandler and Studlar 1999). Instead, the idea of global markets helps to shift the focus away from reliance on nationally based markets for ﬁlm to focus rather on linguistic and cultural markets that explain more fully how Sen to Chihiro was able to synthesise the needs of various markets through its imagery and multiple language tracks.2
Remembering Japan: National identity and domestic negotiation in Sen to Chihiro Within Japan, Sen to Chihiro’s aesthetic look and imagery had a vital role to play in its success. The ﬁlm was not sold through an essentialist or pure image of national identity, but rather evinced a broad spectrum of hybridised identities: with mixed Japanese and Western styles of architecture, décor and costuming; in its characterisation and even in its marketing. For this reason, even in its domestic market, Sen to Chihiro was reliant on a more supra-national identity to attract audiences, its preliminary contemporary setting reﬂecting the broader hybrid nature of Japanese culture itself. Before examining Sen to Chihiro’s marketing in Japan, however, it is imperative to understand how the ﬁlm appealed to national, domestic audiences at a textual level. Doing so will help to explain why particular elements and characters later featured heavily in Sen to Chihiro’s advertising. The narrative of Sen to Chihiro has been related to that of Alice in Wonderland, particularly the 1951 US Disney version (The Economist 2002: 122). In the ﬁlm, Chihiro, a young lethargic Japanese girl, wanders through a tunnel into a mysterious spa resort where gods go to unwind. In the process Chihiro’s parents are transformed into pigs by the sorceress Yuba¯ba, the leader of the resort, which is set in a traditional Japanese-style bath house. In order to survive in this enchanted realm Chihiro has to work, and to save her parents and the boy who befriends her, she undertakes a quest. This, while a rather drastic reduction of the ﬁlm’s narrative, reﬂects the transition from the real to the enchanted undertaken in Sen to Chihiro as well as the narrative impetus to repair Chihiro’s ruptured ‘normal’ life and to escape the enchanted one she enters. What is perhaps most signiﬁcant is that in Sen to Chihiro it is fantasy elements which are most obviously Japanese. Modern Japan appears for only a very limited time as the framing story for Sen to Chihiro’s narrative. Chihiro and her parents travel to their new home in their European car (clearly marked by a rear badge as a German-made Audi) with Chihiro surrounded in the back seat by the trappings of modern Japanese society (a Kinokuniya bookstore bag, a Miffycharacter carrier bag, and a wilting bunch of non-domestic sweet-pea ﬂowers that disintegrate during the ﬁlm’s opening scenes). This framing story and the normality it represents are indicative of Miyazaki’s negative reading of contemporary Japan, ﬁlled as it is with signs of consumerism and personal lethargy. Chihiro’s clothing also becomes symbolic of her character’s (national) identity throughout the ﬁlm. At ﬁrst she wears an oversized white T-shirt with a green stripe, a pair of orange shorts, and yellow trainers that look disproportionately large on her skinny frame. By contrast, Chihiro’s ‘Sen’ costume, her uniform at the bath house, is ‘Oriental’ and traditionally Japanese, consisting of shorts and a top with kimono sleeves in a co-ordinated terracotta orange, white and dark blue colour scheme (see Minear 2001 on Orientalism and Japan). Her appearance in this uniform coincides with her renaming by Yuba¯ba as ‘Sen’, an act which steals Chihiro’s memory of her real name and identity. It is only when Haku, Chihiro’s friend and potential romantic interest, returns her original clothing that she regains her identity by reading the farewell card from the framing story. On regaining her name, Chihiro re-adopts her original clothing but wears a hair band made for her by her friends in this enchanted land. Thus it is that her identity crisis can be mapped at the level of her costuming, with, in the end, her original Westernised identity reasserted, but with some small alterations that will help her to recall her ‘Japanese’ adventure. As well as clothing reﬂecting the ‘real’ and ‘fantastic’, Sen to Chihiro could also be interpreted as playing European and Japanese architectural styles off against one another. The ostentatious Japanese bath house acts as a site of untrustworthy fantasy and magic whereas Zenı¯ba’s (Yuba¯ba’s twin) Europeanstyle house represents a site of the ‘authentic’ or trustworthy. It is at Zenı¯ba’s simple, thatched, rural home that Chihiro’s quest comes to a close. Surrounded by old-fashioned spinning machinery and a range-stove, Chihiro is given the advice that will enable her to return home and help her to free her parents and Haku. By comparison, the gaudy bath house run by Yuba¯ba is reminiscent of the most traditional but outlandish of Japanese architectural styles. It has a formal Japanese garden complete with sliding paper doors through which Chihiro wanders near the beginning of her adventure. Other aspects of the bath house also reﬂect the opulence inherent in certain forms of Japanese architecture and traditional art, such as Yuba¯ba’s enormous Satsuma-ware style vases, and the theatrically painted walls and sliding doors of the bath house itself. The positioning of this opulent traditionalism as fantastic has two levels of signiﬁcance. First, it connotes the traditional identity lost to Chihiro’s modern Japanese character, but also and somewhat contradictorily, its juxtaposition with both the ‘real’ world and Zenı¯ba’s home creates the bath house as an unstable and treacherous environment, but one with valuable lessons for modern (Japanese) society. Compounding this interpretation, the characters most closely associated with an ‘Oriental’ or Japanese identity are presented as conﬂicted in Sen to Chihiro. Haku’s dual identity as boy and dragon, as love interest and Yuba¯ba’s henchman, provides one good example of this trend. Several more of the most transparently Japanese characters in this ﬁlm also have their identities immediately obfuscated through the donning of actual masks. Kaonashi (literally translated as ‘No Face’), a mysterious ﬁgure cloaked in black, has as his face a decorated mask and has the ability to vanish from sight entirely. Furthermore, the river god that Chihiro helps to clean enters the bath house as an Okusare-sama or ‘Stink Spirit’ and is also revealed from under his layer of ﬁlth as having a face reminiscent of a Japanese theatre mask. Hence there is evidence of identity crises in many of Sen to Chihiro’s traditional Japanese characters: Haku’s inability to remember himself, Kaonashi’s search for a place to belong and the Stink Spirit’s need for transformation. The plurality within these characters, speciﬁcally those characters linked visually to Japanese culture, points to a crisis of identity at the heart of Sen to Chihiro’s narrative, caused at least in part by the ﬁlm’s need to succeed beyond as well as within its national boundaries. Thus there is little sense of a straightforward Japanese identity in Sen to Chihiro’s narrative and imagery; uncertainty and transformation are the rule rather than the exception in Miyazaki’s most psychologically complex animated world to date
